SumOfUs is the world’s first truly global consumer watchdog.

Barely a day goes by without a fresh corporate scandal making  headlines. From polluting the environment to dodging taxes -- when left unchecked, corporations don’t let anything stand in the way of bigger profits.

In an age of multinational companies that are bigger and richer than some countries, it can be easy to feel powerless. But there is a chink in their armour. The biggest corporations in the world rely on ordinary people to keep them in business. We are their customers, their employees, and often their investors. When we act together, we can be more powerful than they are.

SumOfUs is a community of people from around the world committed to curbing the growing power of corporations. We want to buy from, work for and invest in companies that respect the environment, treat their workers well and respect democracy. And we’re not afraid to stand up to them when they don’t.

Together, our community of millions act as a global consumer watchdog -- running and winning campaigns to hold the biggest companies in the world accountable.

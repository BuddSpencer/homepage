Activists Submit 280,000+ Comments to the US Forest Service Demanding an End to Nestl=C3=A9 Water Bottling in the San Bernardino National Forest

Groups Call for Thorough and Unbiased Environmental Impact Statement Before Considering Nestl=C3=A9 Request for New Water Bottling Permit

CALIFORNIA -- More than 280,000 members of the California-based Courage Campaign Institute, The Story of Stuff Project, Food and Water Watch, Care2, CREDO, SumOfUs and the Daily Kos have submitted comments to the US Forest Service requesting the Forest Service not approve Nestl=C3=A9=E2=80=99s new permit for water bottling in the San Bernardino National Forest. =20

The coalition of groups submitted their public comments to Jody Noiron, the San Bernardino Forest Supervisor and Thomas Tidwell, US Forest Service Chief of Staff with a letter reading:

=E2=80=9CThe undersigned 280,355 members of The Story of Stuff Project, Courage Campaign, Food and Water Watch, Care2, CREDO, SumofUs, Daily Kos request that you take expedient action to turn off the spigot on Nestl=C3=A9=E2=80=99s unregulated water bottling in the San Bernardino National Forest, and ensure that a thorough and unbiased Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is completed before considering any request by Nestl=C3=A9 to further access our public forest.

=E2=80=9CNestl=C3=A9 has a track record demonstrating a frequent disregard for the wellbeing of communities and ecosystems worldwide. We feel that by allowing Nestl=C3=A9 to continue operating unregulated the Forest Service=E2=80=99s is disregarding its legal obligation to manage public resources like water, plants and animals sustainably -- to hold it in trust for future generations. Now that the water flow in San Bernardino=E2=80=99s Strawberry Creek is at a mere 10% of its 90 year historic average, further action should not be delayed. Please demonstrate that the Forest Service takes public forest protection seriously by shutting off Nestl=C3=A9=E2=80=99s operations today.=E2=80=9D

Last year, the Story of Stuff Project, the California-based Courage Campaign Institute, and the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit against the US Forest Service for allowing Nestl=C3=A9 to continue to bottle millions of gallons of water from the San Bernardino National Forest with a permit that expired 27 years ago.   The lawsuit specifically challenged Nestl=C3=A9=E2=80=99s four-mile pipeline that siphons water from San Bernardino National Forest=E2=80=99s Strawberry Creek to bottling operations in Ontario, California. =20

Following the lawsuit, the US Forest Service announced plans to review and renew Nestl=C3=A9's permit for another five years.

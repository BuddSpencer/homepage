Hi,

Just wanted to make sure you saw that CODEPINK is protesting Airbnb’s
illegal Israeli settlements at TechCrunch’s Disrupt in NYC this week. Last
March, the corporate accountability group SumOfUs launched a petition

urging Airbnb to stop these same settlements. Let me know if you’d like to
speak with any organizational representatives.

Thanks,
Anna

*Activists Protest Airbnb Board Member Alfred Lin at TechCrunch Disrupt -
NYC, Demand Airbnb Stop Listing Homes in Illegal Israeli Settlements*

May 11, 2016, Brooklyn, N.Y. — CODEPINK organizer Ariel Gold disrupted a
talk by Airbnb Board of Directors Member Alfred Lin at TechCrunch Disrupt -
NYC at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal Wednesday morning. As Lin was speaking
to the audience Gold unveiled a banner reading “Airbnb hosts apartheid.”
She asked Lin to have Airbnb stop listing homes in illegal Israeli
settlements in violation of international law. Outside, activists from
CODEPINK, Jewish Voice for Peace and other human rights organizations held
signs and banners reading “No Airbnb in #StolenHomes.” They handed out
flyers to incoming TechCrunch Disrupt attendees asking them to tell Lin to
use his influence as an Airbnb board member to have Airbnb immediately
remove settlement listings from their website.

Israeli settlements contravene both international law and official US
policy. By listing homes in Israeli settlements, and earning a 9-15% fee
from hosts and guests, Airbnb is directly profiting from Israeli apartheid
and land theft. A Human Rights Watch report
published
in January stated that businesses should withdraw from the settlements to
end their complicity in "an inherently unlawful and abusive system that
violates the rights of Palestinians." That same month, Saeb Erekat,
secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, sent Airbnb a
letter 
warning
that Airbnb is “effectively promoting the illegal Israeli colonization of
occupied land.”

On March 10 the Stolen Homes coalition - comprised of American Muslims for
Palestine, CODEPINK, Jewish Voice for Peace, US Campaign to End the Israeli
Occupation, United States Palestinian Community Network and Sum of Us -
delivered 140,000 signatures to Airbnb offices across the world demanding
Airbnb immediately stop listing properties in illegal Israeli settlements
in the occupied West Bank. After the March 10 petition delivery, Airbnb
responded in the San Francisco Chronicle by calling their  business in the
Occupied Palestinian Territories “complex” and stating: "people have been
debating this matter for 5,000 years, so a hospitality company from San
Francisco isn't going to have all the answers but at the end of the day, we
want to help open the world, not close it off.” Contrary to Airbnb’s
statement, Israel’s settlement enterprise is part of a decades-old military
occupation that has confiscated 42%
 of
Palestinian land for settlement construction, resulting in the loss of
freedom of movement and other severe human rights abuses against the
Palestinian people.  By listing rentals in Israel’s illegal settlements,
Airbnb is facilitating and benefiting from the transfer of Israeli
civilians into occupied territory, which is forbidden under the Fourth
Geneva convention.

Alfred Lin joined the Airbnb board of directors in 2013. He is a partner at
Sequoia Capital which has been a major investor in Airbnb since the
company’s inception and is a sponsor of this year’s TechCrunch Disrupt -
NYC conference. CODEPINK’s Ariel Gold states, “Alfred Lin’s position on the
board of Airbnb makes him complicit in Israel’s human rights abuses against
Palestinians. It is time for Lin and Airbnb to recognize the damage caused
by settlement profiteering and immediately cease contributing to the forced
displacement of Palestinians.”

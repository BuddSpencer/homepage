HANNOVER -- On Saturday, April 23rd, more than ten thousand German citizens will take part in a massive demonstration against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) trade deals.  The massive protest takes place just one day ahead of President Obama=E2=80=99s scheduled visit to Hannover where he is expected to appear at the official opening ceremony of the world=E2=80=99s largest trade fair, HANNOVER MESSE 2016, to promote the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership currently being negotiated between Europe and the United States.

WHEN: Saturday, April 23rd.12:00pm LOCAL TIME
WHERE: Hannover - Opernplatz,  30159 Hannover, Germany

At the protest, members of SumOfUs.org, an international consumer watchdog, will join with more than 20 different organizations and tens of thousands of protesters urging German elected officials to reject the trade deals, and prioritize protections for the environment, workers rights, consumer rights and access to affordable medications.  Protesters argue that the TTIP trade deal would undermine democratic decision-making by allowing secret courts that could sue national governments, threaten environmental and health regulations and degrade working standards.

In an expression of trans-Atlantic solidarity, nearly 40 German members of SumOfUs will carry =E2=80=9Csolidarity selfies=E2=80=9D from US citizens opposing the trade deal.

In the last year, more than 3,000,000 people in Europe and around the world have signed onto a petition from SumOfUs and more than 500 other European organizations calling on European authorities to end negotiations with the US on the TTIP and to vote against ratification of CETA with Canada.

=E2=80=9CThese trade deals spell disaster for our environment, protections for workers and consumers, and access to affordable medications. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would give big corporations all the tools they need to bully our governments and undermine critical protections.The trade pact not only grants companies the right to influence our laws, but also allows corporations to sue governments over lost profits. It is the people on both sides of the Atlantic who are standing to lose,=E2=80=9D explained Wiebke Schr=C3=B6der, a German campaigner for SumOfUs.org.  =E2=80=9CHundreds of corporate lobbyists and government officials thought it would be easy to push these massive trade deals through - but they were wrong.  Across the continent, Europeans are rejecting this corporate power grab and will work to make sure our elected officials in Europe oppose these dangerous trade deals.=E2=80=9D

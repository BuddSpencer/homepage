## I made a mistake with my monthly donation! How can I change or edit my donation?

If you created an account, you can login at our members’ management portal at members.sumofus.org. Make sure to use the same email that you use when you receive emails and take action with SumOfUs.  There, you can delete any payment method you no longer want associated with your account.

## Are my donations to SumOfUs tax deductible or eligible for schemes like UK gift aid?

As a 501(c)4 organisation, small donations (under $1,000) aren’t tax deductible or eligible for schemes like the UK’s Gift Aid. For more information on tax deductibility where you live, please contact your local tax authorities.
  
If you are domiciled in the United States we can take tax-deductible contributions over $1,000. Please send us a message for more information about this option.


# Financial Information 

## Where is SumOfUs registered?

SumOfUs is a registered 501(c)4 social welfare nonprofit incorporated in the District of Columbia, United States. We’re also registered in the states of California and New York in the United States and have branches in the United Kingdom and Ireland. 

## What is a 501(c)4 nonprofit?

A 501(c)4 organisation is a type of tax-exempt nonprofit organization in the United States. In the US both 501(c)3s and 501(c)4s are qualified as tax-exempt organizations under tax law. However (c)3 organizations may only do charitable work (as defined by the tax authorities) while c(4)s can also engage in lobbying of public officials and work with trade unions, which is a key part of our work challenging corporate power. Because we are not a 501(c)3, contributions to SumOfUs are not tax deductible.

## Is SumOfUs audited?

Yes. SumOfUs is regularly audited by Lederer, Levine & Associates, LLC, an independent, full-service accounting firm based in the United States. We have always received what is called a “clean opinion,” namely that no irregularities have ever been found and that we follow all relevant accounting rules and procedures.

## How are you funded?

SumOfUs doesn’t accept any contributions from governments or corporations: we are mainly funded by people like you. We are also funded by a small number of foundations and trusts. Please see this chart for more detail on the proportion of grants to independent small online donations.

Our goal is to be increasingly funded primarily by small individual contributions. This funding model means we are able to stay independent, keep pressure on governments and corporations, and respond quickly to crisis situations.


## How do you spend your money?

Below is a breakdown of how we spend our money. We are a very lean organization and staff so we minimize overheads and spend the vast majority of our money on running campaigns.

<%= partial 'expenses' %>

## What happens when you raise more money than you need for a given campaign?

Our members are extremely generous with their donations and we sometimes raise more money than we need for a particular action or request. In this circumstance, any additional money is used to fund a range of core program activities at SumOfUs, such as our staff and the technology that allows us to run and win our campaigns.
    
We operate a no-questions-asked refund policy for any member that wishes to withdraw their donation.
